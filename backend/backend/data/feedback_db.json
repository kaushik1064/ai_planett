We could use the power rule along with the chain rule as well of course, but this what one is often asked in the beginning of a calculus course.\nNote that to help simplify the expression for the derivative, we will make use of the conjugate, a common technique to help simplify these types of expressions with square roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#math, #algebra, #khanacademy, #khan, #geometry, #education, #montessori, #calculus, #homeschooling, #functions, #notation, #organicchemistry, #organicchemistrytutor, #calculus, #derivative, #powerrule, #limits,  #limit, #graph, #graphing, #conjugate, #infinity, #patrickjmt, #rational, #shortcut, #trick, #commondenominator, #fraction, #university, #admissions, #test #continuity #onesided #infinite #absolutevalue #tangents #tangentsandnormals #tangentline #definition #hindi #india\n126 comments\n",
